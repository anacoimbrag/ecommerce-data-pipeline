-- Vitrine inteligente personalizada (caso de uso 3): top-12 produtos por
-- cliente, combinando 3 sinais em SQL puro (regra de scoring do plano):
-- 1) similaridade de produto (ml/recommendations/train_item_similarity.py),
--    com decaimento por recência da compra original (meia-vida ~90 dias);
-- 2) cesta de compra (product_affinity, lift normalizado 0-1 via x/(1+x));
-- 3) fallback content-based por categoria/marca favorita (cold start),
--    peso fixo 0.5 — só preenche vaga quando 1 e 2 não bastam.
