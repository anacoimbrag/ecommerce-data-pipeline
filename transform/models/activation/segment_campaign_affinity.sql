-- "O que funciona melhor por segmento" calculado a partir do histórico real
-- de conversão (uso de cupom em fct_order_line), não de uma tabela de
-- regras escrita à mão. Grão: 1 linha por (segment_label, promotion_id).
-- Depende de feat_customer_segment_labels (não de activation.customer_profile)
-- para não criar um ciclo: customer_profile lê esta tabela pra escolher a
-- próxima campanha quando não há propensity_score do cliente.
